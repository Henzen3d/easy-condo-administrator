# Progress

**What Works:**
-   The basic structure of the meter readings form is in place.
-   The form can fetch units and utility rates.

**What's Left to Build:**
-   Ensure the meter readings form is fully functional.

**Current Status:**
-   The meter readings form had an error due to a missing column in the Supabase database. This has been resolved by using the `owner` column instead.

**Known Issues:**
-   None
